# Sanicare
Sanicare is a Python-kivy project which provides a model of an app that shows the disposal of sanitary pads on a map of two cities, Thane and Mumbai. The data isn't real but it can be used as a model to be hooked up to servers for multiple use cases.

This app generates random values for recycling plants on the map and the data isn't real.

Steps to install and use:
1. Download the zip file and extract it.
2. Make sure to have python 3.9 or above, kivy, kivymd, kivy_garden and webbrowser libraries installed.
3. CD into the directory and run 'python main.py'

PS: If it doesn't run, try changing 'from kivy_garden.mapview' to 'from kivy.garden.mapview' in line 12 of main.py.

This project was made in the year 2022 as a science project of DAV Public School, Thane and was used in a competition, which won the 2nd prize. I was one of the developers on the team, and the only one left who may still update it as I like the idea. There is no planning of future updates or anything really.
